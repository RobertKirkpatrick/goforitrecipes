title: All-Purpose Pie Dough
image: C205A240-756E-4E6D-B72B-398F38353313.jpg

ingredients:
- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
- 2 tablespoons vegetable shortening, cold
- ¼ teaspoon of kosher salt
- Yolk of 1 egg, beaten
- 1 teaspoon cider vinegar
- ¼ cup water, from 3/4 cup ice water.

directions:
- Using your fingertips or the pulse function of a food processor, blend together the flour, fats and salt until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. There should be pebbles of butter throughout the mixture.
- Add egg yolk and vinegar to 1/4 cup ice water and stir to combine. Drizzle 4 tablespoons of this mixture over the dough and gently stir or pulse to combine. Gather a golfball-size bit of dough and squeeze to combine. If it does not hold together, add a little more of the liquid and stir or pulse, then check again. Repeat as necessary.
- Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gather together into a rough ball. You want to be careful not to overwork the flour, but not too careful; the dough should hold together. Divide the ball in half with a knife or a pastry scraper, then divide each portion in half again, and again, to create eight portions. Using the heel of your hand, flatten each portion of dough once or twice to expand the pebbles of butter, then gather the dough together again in one ball. Divide this ball in half.
- Flatten each ball into a 5- or 6-inch disc and dust lightly with flour. Wrap the discs in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 60 minutes.
