ingredients:
- 1 egg, slightly beaten
- 1 ½ c buttermilk
- 1 T canola oil
- 1 c flour
- 1 T (yes tablespoon) baking powder
- 2 T sugar
- ½ t baking soda
- ½ t salt
- ¼ c dry farina cereal (Cream of Wheat)

directions:
- In a bowl, combine and mix together liquid ingredients. 
- In another bowl, completely mix together the dry ingredients. 
- Add the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix; batter will be lumpy. 
- Heat a frying pan or griddle over medium hot burner, the pan is hot enough when drops of water sprinkle on it immediately sizzle. Spray with non-stick cooking spray. Using a ladle, pour batter into what will be the center of the pancake. Pouring the batter in this way results in a perfectly round pancake. Bake pancake until bubbles start to appear on surface. Flip over and continue cooking until browned on the other side.

Probably the best pancake recipe we know. One of these days we hope to get to Chattanooga and try the [real thing](http://www.arethas.com/)!
