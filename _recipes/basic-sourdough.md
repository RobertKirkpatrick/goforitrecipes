image: basic-sourdough.jpg

ingredients:
- 200 grams [sourdough starter](/maintaining-a-sourdough-starter.html) at peak activity 
- 400 ml lukewarm water
- 610 grams flour
- 18 grams salt
- 2 teaspoons diastatic malt powder (optional)

directions:

- Dissolve starter in water in a large bowl. 
- Mix in flour, salt, and malt powder (if using) to form a dough. Note that it will be somewhat shaggy and loose.
- Cover and let rest for 1 hour.
- Dip hand in water (to prevent sticking) and perform a series of turns by reaching down one side of the bowl and pulling the dough from the bottom to the top. Cover and let rest again for one hour.
- Perform another series of turns. Cover, and let rest an additional hour before performing an additional set of turns for a total of 3 series of turns.
- Place bowl in refrigerator for 8-48 hours.
- Remove bowl from fridge and form the dough into a ball on a floured counter. Let rest 15 minutes.
- Place dough into floured banneton or bowl lined with floured cloth. Cover and let rest for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Note dough will not rise much but will warm and relax. 
- 45 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 450 degrees and place a pizza steel or stone on the top rack.
- Immediately before baking, place a cookie sheet on the bottom rack of the oven and fill with water. This will produce steam during the baking process
- Turn dough onto a pizza peel, score the top, and slide onto pizza steel. Bake for 40 minutes or until internal temperature reaches 210 degrees.
