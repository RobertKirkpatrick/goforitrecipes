title: Butternut Squash and Ricotta Pizza
image: B1625818-4EFE-42C1-B46B-2C7590B191D8.jpg

ingredients:
- 20 oz. of your favorite pizza dough (We like this one from Jim Lahey, but the dough in this photo came from Whole Foods.)
- ½ cup olive oil
- 8 large cloves garlic, peeled and halved
- 6 green onions, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon cornmeal or semolina flour
- 1 small butternut squash, shaved into thin slices with a vegetable peeler (about 4 large handfuls shaved)
- 1 pound ricotta
- red pepper flakes to garnish
- Parmesan cheese to garnish

directions:
- Divide dough into two balls or three sections, depending on how thin you like your crust (see note above) and let it come to room temperature.
- Preheat oven to 500ºF.
- Pour olive oil into a 12-inch cast iron pan over medium low heat. Add garlic and the white and light green parts of the sliced onions, followed by a large pinch of kosher salt.
- Gently cook until aromatics are soft, 3-5 minutes. Pour oil into a small bowl and set aside. Wipe pan clean with a towel.
- Place pan in the oven on the lowest possible rack.
- Sprinkle a large piece of parchment paper with cornmeal, place dough on it, brush with garlic oil, and roll dough into a 12” round.
- Using oven mitts, remove the hot cast iron pan from the oven and transfer the dough into it using the parchment paper.
- Quickly brush the dough with more garlic oil, place two large handfuls of squash on it, then season with kosher salt.
- Bake 6-9 minutes on the lowest rack of your oven.
- Remove from oven, drizzle with more garlic oil, then top with ricotta, red pepper flakes, Parmesan and the dark green parts of the onion.
- Repeat steps 6-10 with remaining sections of dough.
