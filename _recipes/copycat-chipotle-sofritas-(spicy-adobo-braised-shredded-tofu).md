title: Copycat Chipotle Sofritas (Spicy Adobo Braised Shredded Tofu)
image: 4f4a596b-932b-4ca3-bcbf-275494bed107.jpg

ingredients:
- 16 oz extra-firm tofu
- 2 tbsp grapeseed oil (or other neutral, high-heat oil)
- For the spice blend
- 1 and 1/4 tsp cumin seeds lightly toasted
- 1 tsp coriander seeds lightly toasted
- 1/4 tsp black peppercorns lightly toasted
- 1/2 tbsp dried oregano leaves
- 1 tsp coconut sugar or other sugar
- For the spicy adobo sauce
- 1 medium poblano pepper
- 2 tb chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
- 2 tb additional adobo sauce
- 1/2 cup water or low-sodium vegetable broth divided
- 1/2 white or yellow onion finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic minced
- 1 and 1/2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce (or tamari)
- 1 tbsp cider vinegar
- 1 tsp nutritional yeast (optional, for added umami)
- 1/4 tsp salt plus more to taste (I personally went up to almost 1/2 tsp.)

directions:
- Prep the tofu
- Press the tofu using a heavy object & towels, or your tofu press, for at least 5 minutes to remove any excess moisture. Slice the tofu into about 8 slices.
- In a skillet, add 1 tb. or so of grapeseed oil over medium-high heat, until shimmering. Add as many slices of tofu as you can fit without crowding.
- Cook the tofu for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until evenly browned all the way around the outside. Remove from the heat and repeat with remaining slices of tofu. Set aside.
- Once the tofu has cooled, chop it into very small pieces, or to the size desired.
- Prep the spice blend
- In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and peppercorns just until they start to smell fragrant. Add them to a spice grinder or mortar & pestle, along with the oregano and sugar. Grind into a fine powder.
- Char the poblano pepper
- If you have a gas stove, then turn on a burner with a low flame and place the pepper over the flames, using metal tongs if needed to hold it in place. Rotate the pepper occasionally, until it is browned on all sides and soft in the middle. The pepper should look like it has collapsed in on itself. You could also grill the pepper, or roast it in the oven until browned and soft. See the notes for suggestions on managing the spiciness or substituting for this ingredients.
- Remove the skin, stem and seeds from the pepper.
- Prep the sauce and braise the sofritas
- In a blender or food processor, combine the poblano pepper, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, about half of the water or broth, onion, garlic, tomato paste, soy sauce, vinegar, and optional nutritional yeast. Process until completely smooth.
- Add the sauce to a large skillet or saucepan along with the chopped, fried tofu. Bring to a gentle boil and then reduce the heat to medium.
- Add the rest of the water/broth, the salt, and about half of the prepared spice blend. Cover the pan, and cook for 5-7 minutes.
- Taste for seasoning and add more salt and/or more of the spice blend as desired. Stir, cover again, and cook for about 5 more minutes, or until most of the liquid is absorbed and the raw onion and garlic taste is gone.
- Enjoy in a burrito bowl, or anywhere else with Mexican-inspired flavors!
