title: Daddy's Famous Roasted Chicken
image: 

ingredients:
- 1 whole chicken.  Roaster preferred over fryer
- 8-10 whole garlic cloves 
- Ground Marjoram
- Salt

directions: 
- The night before you plan to roast the chicken, clean it and remove giblets
- Use a sharp, pointy knife to pierce the skin in the following way. Make a hole large enough to insert a garlic clove and the marjoram between the skin and the meat. 
- Make two holes in the breast, one in each wing, one in each leg, and one in each thigh. 
- Through each pierced hole, place 1/4 tsp ground marjoram, then one whole garlic clove. 
- Then cover the entire chicken with salt. Spread salt liberally. When you believe you have spread too much salt, and are sure you have ruined it, you are getting close, give it a little more. 
Cover the chicken with plastic wrap and place the chicken in the refrigerator overnight. 

Roasting process:

- Get the roasting device up to 500 degrees. Wood or charcoal fired oven or grill is recommended. An indoor oven can work as well, but there is a risk of intense smoke. 
- Place the chicken in a disposable aluminum tray, on the grill, away from direct heat. 
- Leave in the oven for approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees. 
- Let the chicken rest for 5 to 10 minutes
- Serve as normal.

A delicacy from my childhood. I think it originally came from NPR.
