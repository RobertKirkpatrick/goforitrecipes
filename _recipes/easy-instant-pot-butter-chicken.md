image: 2f0d9d72-63fb-4fa6-b432-2e06b74022e4.jpg

ingredients:
- 6 chicken thighs boneless, skinless, cut into cubes
- 1 1/2 c heavy cream
- 1 1/2 c tomato sauce
- 1/2 onion
- 5 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tbsp chopped ginger
- 1 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1 1/2 tsp cumin
- 3 tsp garam masala

directions:
- Turn your Instant Pot to saute, medium, and add butter.
- When butter is melted add cubed chicken and onion.
- Cook just enough for chicken pieces to cook just a touch on the outside.
- Add all other ingredients into your Instant Pot or pressure cooker and mix together well.
- Put lid on and close steam valve.
- Set Instant Pot to manual, pressure, low, for 5 minutes. (enough time if cut into bite size pieces, if larger pieces increase time)
- When done move steam valve just slightly so steam comes out slowly.
- Carefully lift lid. Serve immediately or leave in pot and set to saute low for just a few minutes allowing the sauce to bubble and thicken a bit if you desire. Turn off and allow to cool a bit and rest if you want sauce to thicken a bit more. Serve with rice and/or naan.
