ingredients:
- 1 1/2 pounds (675g) Brussels sprouts, trimmed and split in half
- 3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

directions:
- Adjust oven rack to upper position, place a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on it, and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Toss sprouts with olive oil and season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove baking sheet from oven and add brussels sprouts, working quickly to turn them all cut-side-down. Return to oven and roast until tender and deeply browned, about 20 minutes total.
