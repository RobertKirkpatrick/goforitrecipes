image: 563CF451-2233-4E40-9CF3-3DB613EE778C.jpg

ingredients:
- 3 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil
- 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped
- 1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 ¼ cups French lentils
- 1 teaspoon dried or fresh thyme
- 3 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt

directions:
- Place a large saucepan over medium heat and add oil. When hot, add chopped vegetables and sauté until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
- Add 6 cups water, lentils, thyme, bay leaves and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a fast simmer.
- Simmer lentils until they are tender and have absorbed most of the water, 20 to 25 minutes. If necessary, drain any excess water after lentils have cooked. Serve immediately, or allow them to cool and reheat later.
