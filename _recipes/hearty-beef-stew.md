title: Hearty Beef Stew
image: 06657C79-E799-411D-A6ED-539256B33DB8.jpg

ingredients:
- 3 pounds chuck-eye roast, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes
- 1 ½ teaspoons table salt
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 medium onions, chopped coarse (about 2 cups)
- 3 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 cup red wine (preferably full-bodied)
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 6 small boiling potatoes, peeled and halved
- 4 large carrots, peeled and sliced 1/4-inch thick
- 1 cup frozen peas (6 ounces), thawed
- ¼ cup minced fresh parsley leaves

directions:
- Make this stew in a large, heavy-bottomed soup kettle measuring at least ten inches in diameter. If the kettle is any smaller, you may need to cook the meat in three batches rather than two.
- Heat oven to 300 degrees. Place beef cubes in large bowl. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat in large nonreactive soup kettle; add beef to kettle in two separate batches. Brown meat on all sides, about 5 minutes per batch, adding remaining tablespoon of oil if needed. Remove meat and set aside. Add onions to now empty kettle; sauté until almost softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and add garlic; continue to sauté about 30 seconds longer. Stir in flour; cook until lightly colored, 1 to 2 minutes. Add wine, scraping up any browned bits that may have stuck to kettle. Add stock, bay leaves, and thyme; bring to simmer. Add meat; return to simmer. Cover and place in oven; simmer about 1 hour.
- Remove kettle from oven, add potatoes and carrots, cover, and return to oven. Simmer until meat is just tender, about 1 hour. Remove stew from oven. (Can be cooled, covered, and refrigerated up to 3 days.)
- Add peas and allow to stand 5 minutes. Stir in parsley, adjust seasonings, and serve.
