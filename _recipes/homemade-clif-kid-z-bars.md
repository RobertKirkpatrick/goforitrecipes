image: 17024758-F5CA-4DA5-B785-37E7D3E62C11.jpg

ingredients:
- ½ cup rolled oats (same as old-fashioned oats)
- 1 cup oat flour (I used Bob's Red Mill)
- ¼ cup vanilla plant-based protein powder (I used Bob's Red Mill) OR ¼ cup more oat flour
- ¼ tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- ½ cup applesauce or vanilla Greek yogurt
- ½ cup soy or almond milk (or any milk of choice)
- 1 tsp vanilla
- ½ tsp cinnamon
- 3 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1 Tbsp honey
- 2 tsp coconut oil, divided
- ½ cup mini chocolate chips, divided

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350.
- Spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray or rub with a little oil. Line with parchment paper so there's a little overlap on the sides which you can use to pull bars out later.
- In a mixing bowl, stir together oats, oat flour, protein powder, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon and sugar.
- In a separate bowl, stir together honey, applesauce, milk, vanilla and 1 tsp coconut oil.
- Gently stir the wet ingredients into the dry, then fold in half the mini chocolate chips. Let batter sit for 5 minutes.
- Pour batter into the baking dish and bake 25-30 minutes or until edges begin to brown and middle looks cooked through.
- Cool for 15 minutes in the pan, then lift the parchment paper out to release the bars and cool on a wire rack at least 15 more minutes before cutting.
- Once bars are cut, melt the remaining chocolate chips with the remaining tsp coconut oil in the microwave for 20-30 seconds. Stir until smooth.
- Pour chocolate mixture into a small Ziploc bag, cut off a tiny tip, then swirl the melted chocolate over the cooled bars.
- Set in the fridge for 30 minutes before enjoying.
- Keep any uneaten bars in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.
