title: How to Make Copycat Rx Bars
image: A4C408E2-E6C6-4CDB-A459-CABDADEBAC99.jpg

ingredients:
- 1 cup whole raw almonds (about 5 ounces)
- 1 cup whole raw cashews (about 5 ounces)
- 1 1/4 cups egg white protein powder (3 ounces)
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (2 ounces)
- 1 pound pitted dried dates, preferably Medjool (28 to 30), quartered
- 1/2 teaspoon coarse sea salt

directions:
- Line the pan with parchment paper. Line an 11x7-inch baking pan with a parchment paper sling.
- Process the nuts until finely chopped. Place the almonds and cashews in a food processor fitted with the blade attachment. Process until finely chopped into a crumb consistency, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.
- Process the egg white protein and cocoa powder. Add the egg white protein powder and cocoa powder and process for 30 seconds. You may need to stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
- Add the dates and process until a dough forms. Add the dates and process for 1 to 2 minutes. The processor will be very full so the dough might not form a ball, but it should feel slightly tacky and hold together when squeezed. The mixture will not feel dry or powdery once the dates are completely incorporated.
- Press the date mixture into the pan. Transfer the date mixture to the prepared pan. Press down into an even layer with your fingers. You can also use a small piece of parchment to help you press the dough into a smooth layer and keep your hands from getting too sticky. Sprinkle with the salt and press lightly to adhere.
- Chill and cut the bars. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or freeze for 30 minutes to set. Grasping the parchment, pull the slab out of the pan and place on a cutting board. Using a pizza cutter or large knife, cut into 20 (2- x 1 3/4-inch) bars.
- Store the bars between parchment in an airtight container. Transfer the bars to an airtight container. Divide each layer of bars with a piece of parchment to keep the bars from sticking together. Bars can also be wrapped individually in parchment paper for easy transport.
