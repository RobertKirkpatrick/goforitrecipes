image: A5C7B9F8-1A66-423E-B739-47F8C19CD441.jpg

ingredients:
- 1 Cup + 2 tablespoons very finely ground salted pretzel crumbs (processing crumbs in the food processor for 30 seconds works well.)
- 3 tbsp. Granulated Sugar
- 7 tbsp. Melted butter
- Â½ cup fresh lime juice
- 4 tsp. Grated lime zest
- 4 egg yolks
- 1 14 oz. can Sweet Condensed Milk
- Whipped Cream

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease nine-inch pie pan with nonstick baking spray.
- In a mixing bowl place finely ground pretzels, add sugar and melted butter. Mix to combine.
- Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of the prepared pan. Bake for 8-10 minutes. The crust will not change color much, but it will firm up. Remove from the oven and set aside.
- Preheat the oven to 340 degrees
- Start by removing the zest from the whole lime.
- Cut limes in half and squeeze out juice, being careful to not include any seeds.
- Whisk the egg yolks and lime zest together in a bowl until it's tinted light green. This takes about 2 minutes.
- Beat the milk, then the juice, and set in refrigerator overnight. Pour into the crust and smooth with a spatula.
- Bake the pie for 14 minutes at 340 degrees, until the filling is set, with a small spot in the middle still looking soft. Cool overnight.
- Top with whipped cream and garnish with crumbled pretzels.
