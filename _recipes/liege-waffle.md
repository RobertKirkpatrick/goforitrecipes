image: 643ebe64-869c-417c-b101-4301809db383.jpg

ingredients:
- 1 cup milk
- 2 1/2 teaspoons Lesaffre instant dry yeast
- 4 cups French T55 pastry flour
- 2 eggs
- 6 tbsp. brown sugar
- 1/2 tbsp cinnamon (optional)
- 2 tsp. vanilla extract
- 1 generous pinch of salt
- 10 ounces butter
- 1 cup Waffle Pantry Belgian pearl sugar

directions:
- Gently heat milk to lukewarm temperature. Pour milk into a bowl and add yeast. Allow several minutes for the yeast to dissolve.
- Combine the flour, eggs, brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla extract and salt in bowl.
- Using your mixer's dough hook, mix all the previous ingredients to form a dough.
- Add room temperature butter to dough. The dough should now have a sticky texture.
- Cover the dough in a bowl and let it rest for at least 2 to 3 hours. This will allow the dough's volume to double.
- Once risen, gently mix to allow the air to be released from within the dough. Add Waffle Pantry Belgian pearl sugar to the dough.
- Divide the dough into 10 roughly palm-sized balls and allow them to rest for 15 minutes.
- Pre-heat waffle iron and add each individual dough ball to the machine once it has reached cooking temperature. Monitor for doneness and preferred golden color.
- Voila, your waffles are ready! The optimal time to serve your waffles is straight from the waffle iron. Enjoy!
