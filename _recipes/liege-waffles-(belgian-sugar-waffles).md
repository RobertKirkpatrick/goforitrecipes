title: Liege Waffles (Belgian Sugar Waffles)
image: 30c52457-5fb3-4a6e-832f-7fdf483202be.jpg

ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 3/4 cup almond milk
- 1 packet active dry yeast
- 3 1/2 cups all purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamaon
- 8 ounces (2 sticks) vegan butter, softened
- 4 tablespoons water
- 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 8 ounces Belgian pearl sugar
- powdered sugar, for serving

directions:
- Combine sugar and almond milk in a small bowl. Microwave until the mixture is between 95-115 F. Stir the mixture to dissolve the sugar, then add the yeast. Set aside the mixture for the yeast to develop.
- In a large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the flour, salt, cinnamon, and butter.
- In a separate bowl, combine the water, vegetable oil and baking powder. This is your egg replacer mix. Add the egg replacer mix and the developed yeast mix to the mixer bowl. Mix the dough on medium speed for 3-4 minutes or until dough come together smoothly. It should be thick, like pizza dough. If it’s too dry, add another tablespoon or two of almond milk.
- Leave the dough in the mixer bowl to rise. Cover it with a towel and put it in a warm spot for 30-60 minutes to rise. The dough should double in size.
- Once the dough has risen, mix in the Belgian sugar. Form the dough into 8-12 evenly shaped balls, a little smaller than a baseball.
- Warm your waffle iron and bake until crispy brown. Be very careful removing waffles from the iron. The melted caramelized sugar is extremely hot.
- Let waffles cool for a few minutes before serving.
- If the leftover waffles get too cool, the sugar hardens considerably. Just reheat in the toaster and they’ll spring back to life.
