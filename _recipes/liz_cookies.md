ingredients:
- 3 sticks butter, cut into chunks cold (kirkland)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 Tbsp vanilla (real)
- 1 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 1/4 cup white sugar
- 2 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 4 cups flour (king Arthur’s bleached all-purpose)
- 3 1/2 heaping cups chocolate chips (kirkland)

directions: 
- Preheat oven to 350. 
- Mix butter, eggs, vanilla, and sugars together, not too long. 
- Add baking soda and salt, mix again. 
- Add in 2 cups of flour at a time, add the the baking powder with the first two cups of flour, mix and add the next two cups of flour, don’t overmix. 
- Add chocolate chips. 
- Use a [two inch scoop](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IM2GGSI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), sprinkle each scoop with just a tad kosher salt
- Prep baking sheets with parchment paper. 
- Bake for 14 mins, or until outer edges are golden brown. When you pull the baking sheet out, set pans on cooling racks.
- Tips:
  - Try not to touch the dough as the oils from your hands can change the doughs consistency.
  - I tightly pack the dough in the scoops.
  - I do not smash down the cookie dough after I’ve scooped them
