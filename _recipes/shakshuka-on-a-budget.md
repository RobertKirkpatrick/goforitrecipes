ingredients:
- 2 tbsp olive oil or coconut oil
- 1 yellow onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 red bell pepper (optional)
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- Â½ chili, or more to taste
- 2 cups / 60 g kale (about 2 large leaves without stems) or spinach (fresh or frozen)
- 1 large handful fresh basil or 1 tbsp dried basil
- 2 x 400 g (14 oz) cans whole plum tomatoes
- 4-6 free-range eggs, depending on how many that can fit in your skillet

directions:
- Finely chop onion, garlic and bell pepper. Heat oil in a skillet on medium heat, add onion and garlic, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add bell pepper, cumin and paprika and cook for another couple of minutes. Meanwhile place kale and tomatoes in a food processor or blender and process until you reach the consistency of a finely chopped tomato sauce. Pour the tomato sauce mixture in the skillet and let cook, covered, for 15 minutes. Make small divots in the sauce for the eggs and carefully crack the eggs into them. Cover the skillet with a lid and cook for 5 more minutes, until the egg whites have set. Serve with a few leaves fresh basil and whole grain brown bread or pita.
