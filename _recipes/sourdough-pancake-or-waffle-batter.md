image: 774da7e7-2e8e-41be-8c73-ab23073efc1c.jpg

ingredients:
- 240 grams sourdough starter “unfed”
- 224 grams buttermilk
- 120 grams all-purpose flour
- 13 grams light brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup melted unsalted butter or neutral oil
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 grams kosher salt
- 6 grams baking soda

directions:
- Put the sourdough starter in a large bowl and add the buttermilk, flour and sugar, then stir to combine. Cover the bowl and allow it to rest overnight at room temperature.
- When you are ready to cook, whisk the egg, melted butter or oil and the vanilla extract together in a small bowl, then add the rested sponge. Add the salt and the baking soda to the batter and mix to combine.
- Pour some of the batter onto a preheated greased waffle iron and cook until the waffle is brown and crisp, then repeat. Or use a small ladle to create pancakes on a preheated oiled pan or griddle, flipping them when they are well browned on the bottom. Serve immediately.
