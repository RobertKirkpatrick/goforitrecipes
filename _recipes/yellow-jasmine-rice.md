image: 92C21ECF-66DE-427E-AE6E-A92783071279.jpg

ingredients:
- 2 Tbsp butter $0.22
- 2 cloves garlic, minced $0.16
- 1 tsp turmeric $0.10
- 1/4 tsp cumin $0.02
- 1/8 tsp cinnamon $0.02
- 2 cups uncooked long grain jasmine rice $0.96
- 3 cups chicken broth* $0.38
- 1 bay leaf, optional $0.15

directions:
- Add the butter, garlic, turmeric, cumin, and cinnamon to a medium sauce pot. Saut√© over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic has softened.
- Add the dry rice to the pot. Stir and cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes to slightly toast the rice. You may hear a slight popping or crackling noise as the rice toasts.
- Add the chicken broth and bay leaf to the pot. Place a lid on top, increase the heat to high, and bring the pot to a rolling boil. As soon as it reaches a full boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer (with the lid in place) for 20 minutes.
- After letting it simmer for 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest (do not remove the lid) for an additional 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve.
