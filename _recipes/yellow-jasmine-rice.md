title: Yellow Jasmine Rice
image: 

ingredients:
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1/4 tsp cumin
- 1/8 tsp cinnamon
- 2 cups uncooked long grain jasmine rice
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 1 bay leaf, optional

directions:
- Add the butter, garlic, turmeric, cumin, and cinnamon to a medium sauce pot. Saut√© over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic has softened.
- Add the dry rice to the pot. Stir and cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes to slightly toast the rice. You may hear a slight popping or crackling noise as the rice toasts.
- Add the chicken broth and bay leaf to the pot. Place a lid on top, increase the heat to high, and bring the pot to a rolling boil. As soon as it reaches a full boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer (with the lid in place) for 20 minutes.
- After letting it simmer for 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let it rest (do not remove the lid) for an additional 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve.
